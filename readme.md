Feature extraction is a part of the dimensionality reduction process, in which, an initial set of the raw data is divided and reduced to more manageable groups. So when you want to process it will be easier. 
Why Feature Extraction is Useful?
The technique of extracting the features is useful when you have a large data set and need to reduce the number of resources without losing any important or relevant information. Feature extraction helps to reduce the amount of redundant data from the data set.

Applications of Feature Extraction
Bag of Words- Bag-of-Words is the most used technique for natural language processing. In this process they extract the words or the features from a sentence, document, website, etc. and then they classify them into the frequency of use. So in this whole process feature extraction is one of the most important parts.
Image Processing â€“Image processing is one of the best and most interesting domain. In this domain basically you will start playing with your images in order to understand them. So here we use many many techniques which includes feature extraction as well and algorithms to detect features such as shaped, edges, or motion in a digital image or video to process them.
Auto-encoders: The main  purpose of the auto-encoders is efficient data coding which is unsupervised in nature. this process comes under unsupervised learning . So Feature extraction procedure is applicable here to identify the key features from the data to code by learning from the coding of the original data set to derive new ones
